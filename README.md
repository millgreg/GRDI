# GRDI: Guidelines for Research Data Integrity

This repository provides a practical checklist summarizing the key guidelines for effective data handling, from data collection and processing to final analysis. These guidelines aim to improve data integrity, reproducibility, and transparency in research.  

In addition to the checklist, we include examples of well-structured and poorly structured datasets. These examples highlight common mistakes.  

By following these guidelines and reviewing the examples, researchers can ensure that their data management and analysis practices align with best practices, leading to more robust and reproducible results.
